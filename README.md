Q: Explain what the .md extension represents in github.
Why did Github choose to use this extension over .txt or .html?

A: .md extension stands for Markdown, which Github uses, among others, to format those files.
README.md or .mkdn or .markdown denotes that the file is markdown formatted.
Markdown is a markup language. With it you can easily display headers or have italic words, or bold or almost anything that can be done to text.

Why did Github choose to use this extension over .txt or .html?
In my opinion, the syntax of .md extension to display the same thing in a broswer is more user-friendly than .html
.md can easily format display almost anything that can be done to text, whereas .txt is a standard text document that contains unformatted text.
